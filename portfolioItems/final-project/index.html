    <h1>Basic to Advanced Guide to "The Deathslinger"</h1>
    
    <p>This website will work as a guide to how to play "The Deatslinger" in Dead by Daylight</p>

    <p>There are many killers within this game but there is next to no one who uses Slinger as their main killer and at a such high level.</p>

    <p>As a Prestige 71 Slinger at the time of writing this and lack of proper high-level guides, I will guide you through how to play as Slinger, the vengeful cowboy, in the common levels of play.</p>

    <p>Note: You DO NOT have to read beyond the level of play if you do not want to and just want to have a fun time casually</p>

    </header>

    <h2 id="basic" class="first">Basic Level</h2>

    <p>Reccomended Add-ons: Spit Polish Rag, Tin Oil Can, Modified Ammo Belt, and Warden's Keys </p>

    <p>These add-ons will help you learn the killer's power and its antics without recieving a staggering penalty for missing.</p>

    <p><b>This is your learning phase, make as many attempts with your power to see your mistakes and see what you can do better</b></p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>"The Deathslinger" Characteristics</h4>

    <p><b>Movement Speed:</b> 4.4 m/s</p>

    <p><b>Terror Radius:</b> 32 Meters</p>

    <p><b>Height:</b>Tall (Among the tallest of the cast)</p>

    <p><b>Teir List Placement in Strength:</b>Lower B (S-D)</p>

    <h4>Power: The Redeemer</h4>

    <p>The Redeemer is a gun that you can use to shoot survivors and reel them in to attack them. Survivors can struggle to break the chain to avoid getting hit directly</p>

    <p>The Redeemer is a PROJECTICLE and must have lead if targets are far</p>

    <p><b>Projectile/Spear Speed:</b>40 m/s</p>

    <p><b>Max Range:</b>18 Meters</p>

    <p><b>Reload Time:</b>2.75 seconds</p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>Power Usage</h4>

    <p>The Redeemer can hook anyone as long it hits, once it hits, press and hold (M2/LT) to reel in and once survivors are close enough you can use (M1/RT) to exucute a normal lunge for a hit and cause the "Deep Wound" affect.</p>

    <p><b>Leading Shots</b></p>

    <img src="leadShotS.gif" alt="Leading a Shot">

    <p>Always keep in mind that you need to lead your shots if targets are far</p>

    <p>If you miss a shot during chase, it might be best to just keep walking rather than reloading instantly but depends on the situation</p>

    <p><b>CHAIN BREAK</b></p>

    <img src="chainBreakS.gif" alt="Chain Break Causing Deep Wound">
    
    <p>Occurs when a survivor succefully struggles out of the chain and stuns you but they will enter the "Deep Wound" state. Deep Wound would put a healthy survivor go to the injured state and recieve deep wound. Chain Break will occur much faster if the chain collides with the enviroment or other survivors</p> 

    <p>If you hook a survivor that is HEALTHY and think you may not reel in for the hit, let the chain break to cause a "hit". If the survivor is INJURED already, it is best to (M1/RT) to avoid chain break stun.</p>

    <p><b>Windows and Pallets</b></p>

    <img src="windowShotS.gif" alt="Window Shot">

    <p>The hook can be used to hit survivors over windows but NOT over pallets</p>



    <h2 id="intermediate" class="second">Intermediate Level</h2>

    <p>Reccomended Add-ons/Combos: Warden's Keys/Tin Oil Can combo and Prison Chain</p>

    <p>The add-on combo and Prison Chain will let you get experimental with your shots as you become comfterable with higher-risk, higer-reward shots</p>

    <p><b>At this level, Survivors may start going to safer areas but you can still make some errors</b></p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>Additional "The Redeemer" Characteristics</h4>

    <p><b>Hitbox and Collision Hitbox Size:</b> Extremely Small</p>

    <p><b>Reel Speed:</b> 2.2 m/s w/o collision (Can be Amped if walking backwards when reeling and vice versa if walking forward when reeling)</p>

    <p><b>ADS activation to shot activation:</b>0.4 seconds</p>

    <p><b>ADS Deactivation:</b>0.6 seconds</p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>Power Usage</h4>

    <p>Now that you have gotten accustomed to the power, you could go for a bit more impactful shots</p>

    <p><b>Pallet Interupt</b></p>

    <img src="palletInterruptS.gif" alt="Interrupting path to pallet">

    <p>With "The Redeemer" you can interupt survivor's path to a pallet as most may try to go near one for safety without thinking at this level</p>

    <p><b>Movement Around Very Un-Safe Pallets</b></p>

    <img src="unSafeS.gif" alt="Moving around an un-safe pallet">

    <p>If the survivor drops the pallet as you shoot, you may go around the loop that is connected to the pallet while reeling and reach the other side and hit the survivor directly.</p>

    <p><b>Shooting over low-height obstacles/walls</b></p>

    <img src="overLowS.gif" alt="Low Wall Shot">

    <p>Low-height obstacles/walls are easy to shoot over as the upper half of a survivor is very visible to you and could make for a shot. Just make sure you also move in case you have to go around to reel in properly.</p>

    <p><b>Experimenting with shots</b></p>

    <img src="expShotS.gif" alt="Experimenting">

    <p>Due to the Spear having an extremely small hitbox, you should try go for shots that go through some holes in walls or obstacles</p>



    <h2 id="advanced" class="third">Advanced Level</h2>

    <p>Reccomended Add-ons/Combos: Warden's Keys/Modified Ammo Belt combo, Iridecent Coin, and Iridecent Coin/Prison Chain combo</p>

    <p>As you are hitting more and more with your shots, reload add-ons combo is amazing and there is next to no need for miss recovery add-ons anymore. Iri Coin and Prison Chain combo can be used so you get rewarded much more for long shots with some protection in case of chain break</p>

    <p><b>At this level, Survivors may be looking at YOU during chase to avoid a shot. Making mistakes can make the match rough on you.</b></p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>Additional "The Redeemer" Characteristics</h4>

    <p><b>Input/Shot delay after clicking "Fire":</b> 0.5 seconds</p>

    <p><b>Movement Speed While Reeling:</b>Slower than normal w/o collision but much slower w/ collision</p>

    <p><b>Movement Speed During ADS:</b>3.74 m/s</p>

    <p><b>Reload Movement Speed:</b>2.64 m/s</p>

    <p><b>Delay from Hit to Reel (Grace Period):</b>0.5 seconds</p>

    <p><b>Impending Shot Feature:</b>A ringing sound starts to hear for survivors to warn them about an impending shot. Gets louder the better the aim.</p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>Power Usage</h4>

    <p>Now that you have gotten used to the gun, its time for advanced techniques to try to catch survivors off gaurd.</p>

    <p><b>"Quick Scoping"</b></p>

    <img src="quickScopeS.gif" alt="Shooting as fast as possible">

    <p>Learning how to quick scope or shoot as fast as possible will help with mitigating additional reaction time for survivors looking at you or trying to hear the ringing sound to avoid the shot.</p>

    <p><b>Shooting through loops</b></p>

    <img src="midWallS.gif" alt="Shot Through Loop">

    <p>Some loops have mid-height walls so you could shoot and interupt survivors going around a loop. High wall loops are no exception either as some have a window connected to it so that you could shoot through if your prediction is right. High walls with no windows cant really be done through shooting unless it is to interupt a pallet movement when getting close around the corner.</p>

    <p><b>Mind Gaming with ADS Animation</b></p>

    <img src="adsScareS.gif" alt="ADS Fear">

    <p>You can use your ADS animation to scare survivors trying to dodge your shot and not shooting at all until either the right moment or to cancel to do a basic attack once close. This can be done in the open if survivors are doing zig-zags or crouching in mid-low wall loops</p>

    <p><b>The Grace Period</b></p>

    <img src="gracePeriodS.gif" alt="The Grace Period in Action">

    <p>After a successful hit with the gun, there is a half second period where you could move without the chain break sequence starting. If you use this grace period to your advantage, you can get hits AND downs around somewhat safe pallets like the common big rock loops.</p>

    <p><b>Shooting trough even smaller holes</b></p>

    <img src="smallShotS.gif" alt="Window/Hole Snipe">

    <p>If you are confident with your aim up till this point, you can try to shoot trough small cracks like gaps in fences and shack windows during chase</p>



    <h2 id="sweat" class="fourth">The "Sweat" Level</h2>

    <p>"The" Add-ons/Combos: Warden's Keys/Modified Ammo Belt combo, Iri Coin/Warden's Keys combo</p>

    <p>At top level gameplay, these are the prime add-ons and combos for double shots and insta-downs</p>

    <p><b>At this point, you may be a Deathslinger main and would like to know more. Survivors are ruthless and high MMR will make sure you suffer if not prepared. ONE MISSED SHOT COULD COST YOU THE GAME!!! ONE!!!</b></p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>Additional "The Redeemer" Characteristics</h4>

    <p><b>Camera Angle Affecting Chain Collision:</b>The way your camera is facing can decide whether or not the chain is colliding with something (Unconfirmed)</p>

    <p><b>Positioning Angle Affecting Chain Collision:</b>The way you position yourself while reeling through obstacles can decide whether or not the chain is colliding with something.</p>

    <p><b>Hook Shot Penalty to Survivors:</b>Survivors suffer from getting more distance via injure speed on a hook hit. However, its somewhat minimal.</p>

    <p><b>Upper Hitbox:</b>The hook can still connect to survivors even if it is a bit above their head.</p>

    <p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

    <h4>Power Usage</h4>

    <p><b>Shooting Above Survivors' Heads</b></p>

    <img src="overHeadS.gif" alt="Shot Above Survivor's Head">

    <p>A hitbox still strangely exist above survivors a bit. You could use this to shoot survivors through some specific walls where it is almost the same height as the survivor.</p>

    <p><b>The Double Shot</b></p>

    <img src="doubleShotS.gif" alt="Double Shot Hit">

    <p>If you have both reload add-ons, it's very possible to shoot twice instantly for both hits.</p>

    <p><b>Collision Manipulation?</b></p>

    <p>In some situations you can use your positioning and camera to make the chain not collide with anything but this is in VERY SPECIFIC situations.</p>
