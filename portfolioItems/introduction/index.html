    <p></p>
    <p>An artwork that I like is the concept art of "The Deathslinger" in Dead by Daylight. It puts some spins on the iconic look of the wild west</p>

    <p>I am super excited for a lot of the games that are coming out in these next 3 months. However, I am NOT exicited about Overwatch 2's release</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I highly recommend the Danganronpa series if you are looking for a dense and entertaining story</p>
