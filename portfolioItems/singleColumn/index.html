       <p>The FGC is known to be around for decades but it has only grown to a resonable size for attention just recently in these last few years, but why is it so hard to get into? Well, it is actually for a mutitude of reasons but it mostly stems from the players themselves and the marketing for these games. Players would usually avoid these types of game because they take so much more dedication than other games on other genres, which is true to an extent, but one can still learn while having fun as long as the player sees the game as "interesting" and "intriguing". Those 2 reasons are more than enough to get into these types games and probably decide that their depth is what makes these games extremely fun.</p>

          <h2>The Controllers</h2>

        <p> Now lets say a player wants to get into the genre and they wonder what they should play on when it comes controllers. What should a begginer use? The simple answer is actually using whatever feels the most comfortable, even a custom made one. Not everyone would like to have some huge arcade controller if it feels too heavy or too clunky and this goes for begginers and veterans alike and thats a valid point. I personally use a GameCube controller for my fighting game (yes, I know its weird) but it what I am most comfortable and find joy in using. Long story short, just use whatever you want.</p>

        <p>The community around fighting games, at least from my experience, is amazing and it is the one most fun things I could do when it comes to gaming. There truly is something about having someone be right next to you and fight them metaphorically through the game while talking, strenghening a bond, and getting better along the way. Your opponent does not even need to be right next you, they can be miles, countries away but as long as there is a form of communication like a discord call then it can still produce the same effects as if it was in-person.</p>
        
        <p>While it may be small, eSports around fighting games can also be great because of how much tension there is. Unlike other competitive games, this is a 1 vs 1 setting where it all depends on the player's skill with minimal outside factors to cause an outcome. Not only is it a good way to test yourself, watching a match can also be informal since it can easier to pick apart whats good and whats bad than a team game.</p>
